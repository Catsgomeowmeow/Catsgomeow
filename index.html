                <img id="pic" title="The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective 'future gadgets with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed 'Daru.' The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the 'Phone Microwave,' which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.
                Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success‚Äîthe Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history." style= width:300px;height:450px; src="http://www.worktop-express.co.uk/media/gbu0/prodlg/black-gloss-work-surfaces.jpg";;

A rifle-toting girl named Yuri explains that they are in the afterlife, and Otonashi realizes the only thing he can remember about himself is his name. Yuri tells him that she leads the Shinda Sekai Sensen (Afterlife Battlefront) and wages war against a girl named Tenshi. Unable to believe Yuri's claims that Tenshi is evil, Otonashi attempts to speak with her, but the encounter doesn't go as he intended.

Otonashi decides to join the SSS and battle Tenshi, but he finds himself oddly drawn to her. While trying to regain his memories and understand Tenshi, he gradually unravels the mysteries of the afterlife." style=width:300px; height="450px"; src="http://www.worktop-express.co.uk/media/gbu0/prodlg/black-gloss-work-surfaces.jpg" alt = "Steins;Gate">
